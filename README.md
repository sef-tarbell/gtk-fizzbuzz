# gtk-fizzbuzz
Taking the fizzbuzz test a little further than necessary

This started as a project to understand gtkmm a little better and to figure out how to insert text dynamically into the gtk TextView. I needed text to insert and rather than random text, I used the fizz-buzz coding test. It gave me a reason to figure out how to format the text, just to make it a little prettier.

I wrote this in CLion, which uses a text file to control the make process, but compiling it on the command line should work with something the flags for gtkmm added.
